The goal ist to capture flag posts to secure more respawn positions for the team as well as to extend its influence.

Unlike Occupation, a team can only capture a flag post if it completely controls a nearby flag post.

Every team owns a certain number of tickets, which equal respawns.

A team is eliminated when all tickets are lost. A team looses tickets for every dead team member.
A team gains 5 tickets by capturing a flag post. Losing the flag post subtracts 5 tickets.

A team can win prematurely by capturing all flag posts.
